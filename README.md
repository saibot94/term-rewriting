## Term-rewriting

By Cristian Schuszter.

This project's idea is to implement a sort of goal-proving mechanism. Main points:

* The user can define his or her language (function symbols and constants, arity for the functions in the form of 
"f/n" where n is the number of arguments that the function can receive)
* The program can then accept an arbitrary command line writen by the user and parse it, saying true or false and in case of false
giving the reason for it.
